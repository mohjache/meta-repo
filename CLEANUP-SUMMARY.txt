# Repository Cleanup Complete

All Oracle Cloud VM setup files have been removed.
Repository now focuses exclusively on GitHub Codespaces.

## What Was Deleted

- cloud-init.yaml
- QUICKSTART.md  
- START-HERE.md
- COST-CALCULATOR.md
- ADVANCED.md
- Original README.md (Oracle focused)
- README-CODESPACES.md (merged into README)
- CODESPACES.md (merged into README)
- SETUP-COMPLETE.md (no longer needed)

## What Remains

### Core Configuration
- .devcontainer/
  - devcontainer.json (Codespaces config)
  - Dockerfile (development environment)
  - post-create.sh (auto-setup)

### Scripts (all work with Codespaces)
- scripts/setup-api-key.sh
- scripts/run-safe-loop.sh
- scripts/monitor.sh
- scripts/cleanup.sh

### Documentation & Examples
- README.md (NEW - Codespaces only)
- prompts/PROMPT.md
- example-prompts/ (3 examples + guide)

### Docker & Build
- Dockerfile.ralph
- docker-compose.yml
- Makefile

### Config
- .env.example
- .gitignore

## Result

✓ Clean, focused repository
✓ Zero manual setup required
✓ Everything in code, ready to commit
✓ Team-ready with Codespaces
✓ No Oracle Cloud references

## Next Steps

1. Review README.md for complete guide
2. Commit changes to GitHub
3. Open in Codespaces
4. Run: make setup && make run
